        <h2>What is ethical or sustainable fashion?</h2>
      <p>
         While "fast fashion" describes
        clothing that is cheaply made and intended for short-term use,
        "sustainable" (or "ethical") fashion is the opposite. It takes into
        account the full lifecycle of the product — from the design, sourcing,
        and production processes — and looks at everyone and everything being
        affected by it, from the environment, to the workers and communities
        where it’s produced, to the consumers who purchase it. It’s a complex
        issue and there isn’t one brand that’s currently capable of tackling
        everything, but right now there are five main issues being addressed in
        the fashion industry: 1. Water usage: The demands for fresh water for
        drinking and agriculture is far surpassing what’s available. Yes, the
        Earth is covered in water, but most of it is unusable salt water or has
        been polluted. As a result, some brands are now looking at the supply
        chains to see how they can cut back on how much water they're using. 2.
        Hazardous chemicals: Dyes and finishes from the production processes are
        dangerous for the workers, plus they get into the community water
        sources. These chemicals may not affect the consumers, but they’re a
        problem for the people who make clothing and those who live in areas
        where it’s produced. Fashion and outdoor brands are now tasked with
        coming up with new ways to address dyes and finishes for features like
        wrinkle-resistance and water-repellency. 3. Short lifecycle: Stores are
        constantly launching new designs and consumers are regularly updating
        their wardrobes. The biggest goal in sustainable fashion is to buy less
        and use things longer. To make clothes last, there are platforms for
        closet-sharing, brands that promote buying used clothing, and simple yet
        durable styles that you can wear over and over again. 4. Waste: On top
        of having a short lifecycle, there needs to be a way to create less
        trash by making products useful again once they’ve run their course. One
        way is to repair garments (i.e. mending holes in jeans and replacing
        worn soles of shoes) while another opportunity comes from using recycled
        materials in apparel. 5. Agriculture: Natural fibers like cotton are
        often grown using pesticides and treatments that are harmful to the
        farmers, workers, and wildlife in the area. There are now more options
        for organic cotton, linen, and other fibers available, which also use
        less water than the conventional growing methods. Plus, brands are
        looking at being organic throughout the production process – not just
        the growing of the crop, which is only the first step. What are the most
        sustainable fabrics? The most sustainable fabric is one that’s
        previously been used; anything new that has been produced – regardless
        of what material – has a negative impact on the environment. After that
        comes fabrics made with recycled material. Most commonly you’ll find
        polyester made from recycled water bottles. Just make sure you’re
        looking for specific details, like "100% recycled polyester" (some
        brands might market it as “made with partially recycled materials” when
        it’s really only a small portion). Lastly, fabrics made with sustainable
        fibers are better than conventional ones, like organic fibers that use
        less chemicals and water, or Tencel that’s safer for workers and has
        less waste. Is sustainable fashion affordable? Yes! Buying something
        used is more sustainable than anything new, so it’s automatically going
        to cost you less. This doesn’t mean you have to shop at Goodwill, and
        it’s actually becoming a trend: The fashion industry calls it
        “recommerce.” Sites like eBay, thredUP, and Poshmark make it easy to
        swap out your clothes, and brands like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are
        even selling pre-worn garments from their own labels. Just be cautious
        that you don’t use the cost-savings as an excuse to buy more since
        that'll take away from it being a sustainable purchase. That being said,
        if you’re going to buy new sustainable fashion from brands that follow
        ethical practices and give fair wages, use organic fibers, or create
        more durable items, you may end up paying more – but these garments are
        meant to last longer. What brands are ethical? Different brands focus on
        combating various issues in the fashion industry – some just one, while
        others are tackling multiple. Read on to learn more about brands we love
        that are creating the best options for ethical clothing and accessories.
