          <h5>Wash & Care of Hemp Fabrics</h5>
          Hemp articles of all kinds thrive on regular use and regular
          laundering. Considered "Bulletproof" by many experts hemp is an
          amazingly strong, long-lasting fabric that launders easily. Hemp's
          ultra-durable, cost-saving benefits makes it the perfect natural
          fabric for heavy-wear, uniform-type clothing. It withstands the rigors
          of industrial cleaning processes extremely well. (Note: Commercial
          soap powders and liquid detergents can be safely used and water
          temperature is not critical). Because of the highly porous nature of
          the hemp fiber (i.e., magnified under a microscope it's filled with
          lots of holes) hemp dries extremely quickly naturally (in the open
          air) or is easily tumble-dried.
          <h5>Suggested maximum wash water temperatures for hemp</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hemp without special finishes - unlimited to include boiling
              temperatures
            </li>
            <li>
              Hemp without special finishes, where colors are fast - 65c Note:
              for 1 & 2 above a temperature of 50c is generally sufficient
            </li>
            <li>Fine hand-embroidered hemp should be hand-washed at 40c</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hemp sheds dirt more readily than other materials and with thorough
            rinsing comes clean as new after every wash. If stained, use a
            proprietary stain-remover before washing. There is no need to use
            starch except perhaps for the finest hemps, for hemp has a natural
            crispness. hemp does not have to be tumble-dried - it will naturally
            dry quickly.
          </p>
          <h5>Ironing:</h5>
          <p>
            After conventional machine washing use a fast spin, then hot iron
            while the hemp is still damp. This makes for ease of ironing and
            will maintain appearance. Use a hot iron. Hemp easily handles
            extreme temperatures. Stretch the damp article to its natural size
            and shape before ironing. A hot iron will ensure that creases and
            crumples disappear instantly. Every piece will come up so crisp and
            new that it is impossible to tell whether starch has been used. Iron
            the 'wrong' (underside) first. For colored dress hemps, only iron
            the wrong side. This preserves the texture of the weave.
