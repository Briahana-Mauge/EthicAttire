        Like our label says, when it comes to washing your silk leaving it to
        the experts at the dry cleaners is the absolute best way to extend the
        life of your silk and keep its subtle lustre and delicate hand feel
        (especially if we’re talking stains). However, if you ever find yourself
        in a jam or want an at home way to freshen your silk, then here is how
        you can safely hand wash your favourite pieces.
     
      <h3>Hand Wash</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll want to make sure to do colours separately and read the detergent
        label before using it on your silk. Words like “suitable for silk” and
        “delicates” are your best friends when it comes to washing silk by hand.
        Bleach will damage your silk’s fibres so it’s always a big no.
      </p>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place your silk garment in cold water with a mild silk-friendly
          detergent.
        </li>
        <li>Leave to soak (no more than 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Swish the garment slowly and gently.</li>
        <li>Rinse with fresh water</li>
        <li>
          To help keep its hydrated feel, use a fabric conditioner in the final
          rinse (or even a small amount of hair conditioner).
        </li>
        <li>Rinse well in cold water.</li>
        <li>
          Ball your silk together to remove excess moisture (wringing your silk
          out will damage it’s fibres). Then lay it flat and roll it in a towel
          to absorb any lingering moisture.
        </li>
        <li>Lay flat to dry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Wrinkles and Creases</h3>
      <p>
        Most wrinkles in silk can simply be steamed out, but not everyone owns a
        steamer. A great steamer hack is to hang your silk in the bathroom and
        let it steam while you take a hot shower. If you can’t steam the creases
        out then here are a few tips on how to safely iron your silk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flip your garments inside out and set the iron to low heat (or the
          silk setting). Iron silk only once it’s dry and be sure to put a cloth
          between the silk and the iron. Do not spray or wet silk while ironing,
          you may get water-stains.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
