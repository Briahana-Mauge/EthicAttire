        Let’s just start by saying that caring for linen items is simple and
        rather straightforward — high-quality linen fabric is sturdy and durable
        on its own so you won’t have to slave away tending to its whims.
        However, if you want to make the most of your linen items, here are some
        basic rules you should follow.
     

      <p>
        Linen items can be both hand washed and machine washed - either of these
        methods are fine and won’t stretch or shrink your linens. If you do
        experience damage during wash, it may be related to the quality of the
        fabric or chemicals involved.
      </p>

      <h3>Machine wash:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Separate white, dark, and colored linens. For best results, wash
          separately from other fabrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash in lukewarm water (40°C/104°F). High temperatures may cause
          shrinkage of up to 10% and weaken the linen fiber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the gentle machine cycle and don’t overload your washing machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use mild detergent formulated for delicate fabrics. Don't bleach.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hand wash:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fill a small container (bucket or sink) with lukewarm water and add
          about a teaspoon of mild detergent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Submerge the linen garment in lukewarm water and let it soak for about
          10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently swish the item around. Don’t wring, twist or scrub as it can
          stretch the fabric.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the soapy water and rinse repeatedly until the soapy residue is
          all gone. Hang to dry.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ironing linen:</h3>
        <p>Natural fibers like linen will wrinkle, crumple and crease, you just have to accept it. However, if you really want an item pressed, use a medium-hot iron on the fabric while it’s still damp or overlay it with a damp towel.
