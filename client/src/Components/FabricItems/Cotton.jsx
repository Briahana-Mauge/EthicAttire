        It is difficult to give guidance on washing cotton as there are so many
        types of cotton fabric available and so many uses for it. To be safe you
        should always refer to the care label for your cotton item before
        washing.

        Cotton T-shirts can be prone to shrinking when they are washed and
        dried. To try and stop this happening:
        <ul className="FabricDesc">
          <li>
            Wash in cold (30°C or below) water, whether using a washing machine
            or washing by hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Give garments a gentle stretch when they come out of the wash to get
            them back into shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always air dry: dry clothes flat and out of the sun if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have an item that you know is prone to more than 10%
            shrinkage, hand wash it in cold water.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A suitable temperature for washing towels and sheets is 40°C. However,
          to prevent the spread of germs (eg if someone has been ill), it is
          advisable to wash underwear, towels and household pnen at 60°C using a
          bleach-based product, such as washing powder. You need to combine your
          60°C wash with a good washing detergent to attack bacteria, as some
          bacterial spores and viruses are resistant to washing at 60°C.
        </p>
        <h4>Ironing cotton</h4> 
        <p>Cotton is very prone to creasing so it is often necessary
        to iron it. However, to try to avoid too much ironing: Buy cotton
        clothes that have been treated with a wrinkle resistant finish eg on
        men’s work shirts and children’s school uniforms. The care label will
        tell you if this finish has been applied. Items like T-shirts and jeans
        often don’t need ironing if you gently stretch them when they come out
        of the washing machine and then air dry them flat. Also use the ‘reduced
        creases’ setting on your washing machine if available. If your garments
        do need ironing: Refer to the garment care label to know what iron
        temperature setting is safe. It is best to iron cotton items while they
        are still slightly damp or alternatively use the steam setting on your
        iron. Make sure the items are dry/aired before folding and putting away.</p>
