        Polyester fabrics are strong, resilient, wrinkle-resistant, colorfast,
        crisp, and hold pleats and creases well. But they are also nonabsorbent,
        attract and hold oil stains, may pill when rubbed, and may yellow with
        age. Polyester is used for clothing and filling garments and coats; some
        bed linens and towels are also made from polyester blends. Polyester can
        be safely dry-cleaned or machine-washed.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Turn polyester-knit garments inside out before washing to prevent
            snags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Machine-wash polyester in warm water, using an all-purpose
            detergent. Use a chlorine bleach if necessary. Fabric softener will
            reduce static electricity.
          </li>
          <li>
            White polyester fabric will look even whiter if you soak it
            overnight in a mixture of 1/2 cup automatic dishwashing detergent
            and 1 gallon warm water. Launder as usual, but add 1/2 cup vinegar
            to the final rinse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tumble-dry at a low temperature setting. Do not overly dry
            polyester; this will cause gradual shrinkage.
          </li>
          
        </ul>
   
        <h3>Ironing</h3>
        <p>Press polyester fabrics at a moderate temperature setting, or use
            steam.</p>
