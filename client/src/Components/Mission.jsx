                Ethic Attire is committed to introducing the idea of sustainability in fashion to those who want to start transitioning 
                to a sustainable lifestyle.

                We designed this app with the idea in mind that an individual only needs to have 32 articles of clothing to have a full wardrobe. 
                While we understand that many of us (<em>we're included too!</em> ) have way more than that and that's ok :). We designed a virtual 
                closet that can accompany you wherever you go to help your decisions on if you really need to buy a new article of clothing or that 
                you realize you already have 3 identical shirts.
            </p>
            <br></br>

            <br></br>

            <p>
                As the beginning/entry point for an individual who wants to be more sustainable and needs a bit of direction on how to eventually start 
                living a sustainable life, Ethic Attire is here to help figure out if your closet is populated by items made from sustainable fabric and 
                for those items that aren't, provide with specific care instructions to help extend the wear life of that article of clothing. 
                Ethic Attire also provides you with in companies who have approved with having high sustainable practices throughout their supply chain, 
                so if you are missing any pieces, you know right where you can go to purchase an items.
