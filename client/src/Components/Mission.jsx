            <p>We designed this app with the idea in mind that an individual only needs to have 32 articles of clothing to have a full wardrobe. While we understand that many of us (<em>we're included too!</em> ) 
            have way more than that and that's ok :). We designed a virtual closet that can accompany you wherever you go to help your decisions on if you really need to buy a new article of clothing or that you realize you have 3 identical shirts to the .</p>

            <p>Ethic Attire provides you with in</p>

            <p>There are </p>

            <p>My team decided that we wanted to focus more on the consumer side of the industry and we came up with “closet app”
                where you can enter in you current wardrobe and it will assess how sustainable many sustainable clothing items you currently have.
                The basic wardrobe is based on the 32 basic items everyone need in their closet. There is also an informational side to the app as
                well because the app will prove you with companies who have approved with having high sustainable practices throughout their supply chain.
                And for the items in a users closet that are not made from sustainable fabrics, we tell about the particular fabric and how to care for them
                so that they can extend the wear life of that item which is also a sustainable practice that a consumer can follow.

As the user is entering in their wardrobe and they see that they are missing a few key items from their wardrobe, we would point them in the direction of
companies committed to the mission of sustainability, where they can possibly purchase those missing items.

We are approaching it as the beginning/entry point for the user that wants to be more sustainable but needs a bit of direction on how to
eventually start living a sustainable life.</p>
